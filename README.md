#  Function Frontend

This Solidity program is a simple Front-end connected to the metamask wallet program that demonstrates the basic functionality and error handling concept of the Solidity programming language. This program aims to connect the NextJS application to Metamask Wallet and make transactions between accounts.

## Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The
contract has 3 functions used for deposit, withdrawal, and display balance of that transaction. This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future. It Deploys the code locally and transacts Ethereum locally as this project is a dummy project so actual Ethereum is not in use.

## Getting Started
After cloning GitHub, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

    Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
    Open two additional terminals in your VS code
    In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
    In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
    Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. Typically at http://localhost:3000/

### Executing program
To run this application write in VS Code Console -- npm run dev

contract Assessment {
    address payable public owner;
    uint256 public balance;

    event Deposit(uint256 amount);
    event Withdraw(uint256 amount);

    constructor(uint initBalance) payable {
        owner = payable(msg.sender);
        balance = initBalance;
    }

    function getBalance() public view returns(uint256){
        return balance;
    }

    function deposit(uint256 _amount) public payable {
        uint _previousBalance = balance;

        // make sure this is the owner
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this account");

        // perform transaction
        balance += _amount;

        // assert transaction completed successfully
        assert(balance == _previousBalance + _amount);

        // emit the event
        emit Deposit(_amount);
    }

    // custom error
    error InsufficientBalance(uint256 balance, uint256 withdrawAmount);

    function withdraw(uint256 _withdrawAmount) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "You are not the owner of this account");
        uint _previousBalance = balance;
        if (balance < _withdrawAmount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance({
                balance: balance,
                withdrawAmount: _withdrawAmount
            });
        }

        // withdraw the given amount
        balance -= _withdrawAmount;

        // assert the balance is correct
        assert(balance == (_previousBalance - _withdrawAmount));

        // emit the event
        emit Withdraw(_withdrawAmount);
    }
}

        .container {

          background:yellow;
          border: 5px solid black;

        }
      `}
      </style>
    </main>
  )
}
```

After running the above comment write localhost:3000/ on your browser and the frontend will be displayed and you can transact Ethereum between accounts (i.e either deposit or withdraw)
